# School_District_Analysis
The analysis above shows the clear difference and similarities of student performance in relationship between school budgeting. We take a deep dive into the data when we anaylze the difference in math and reading scores across both public and charter schools. According to the data, we find that both charter and public school perform comparitively the same regardless of the school budget. The data also reveals that some schools perform better in reading while others perform better in math. Overall, students across grade levels seemed to perform better in reading with a mean of 74% (math mean=64%). It would be worthwhile to investigate the socio-economic background of each school as this may affect student performance.
